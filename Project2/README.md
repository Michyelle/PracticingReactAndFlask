# ✈️ Travel Journal  
_A Scrimba React Project – Course 2: Passing Props & Component Design_

This project is a simple, beautiful **travel journal** web app that showcases memorable trips through visual cards. Each card includes a location, a description, a map link, and a photo. It was built using React, and helped me practice breaking down layouts into reusable components and passing props effectively.

✅ **Fully mobile responsive** – optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices!

## 🎯 Purpose  
The goal of this project was to learn how to build structured, data driven UIs in React. I focused on **component design** and **prop passing** while recreating a travel log experience that displays dynamic trip entries in a consistent layout.

## 🧠 What I Learned  
From this project, I gained practical experience in:

- 🧱 Creating clean, reusable components  
- 📨 Passing props to children components  
- 🗃️ Using arrays and `.map()` to render multiple components  
- 🌍 Embedding external map links  
- 🖼️ Working with images and layout design  
- 📱 Designing layouts that work well across screen sizes  
- ✨ Organizing code with clarity and consistency
