# 💀 Meme Generator 😭
_A Scrimba React Project – Course 4: React Forms_  
The Meme Generator is your ultimate laugh factory! 🤣🖼️ Just pick a meme template, type in your top and bottom text, and watch your masterpiece come to life instantly. This app is built using React and focuses on what I learned in Scrimba’s fourth React course on forms and event handling.  

✅ **Fully mobile responsive** – works great on phones, tablets, and desktops!

## 🎯 Purpose  
The purpose of this project was to strengthen my understanding of **React forms and event handling** by creating an interactive and fun meme generator. The goal was to give users an easy way to customize memes in real time with dynamic text rendering over images.
