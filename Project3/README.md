# 👨‍🍳 Chef Claude - AI Recipe Suggestor
_A Scrimba React Project – Course 3: React State_
Chef Claude is your AI sous-chef! 🧠🍳 Just input whatever ingredients you have lying around, and Claude will whip up a list of recipe ideas for you to try. This app is built using React and focuses on what I learned in Scrimba’s third React course on state.

✅ **Fully mobile responsive** – works great on phones, tablets, and desktops!

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
The purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding of **state management in React** by creating an interactive, useful web application. The end goal: a smooth, state-driven user experience where users can add ingredients and get live, dynamic recipe suggestions!

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
From this project, I gained practical experience in:

- 🧺 Managing state using `useState`
- ➕ Updating and resetting arrays in state
- 🎯 Controlled components (inputs, buttons, etc.)
- 🔄 Dynamic rendering based on state
- ❌ Conditional rendering
- 🧼 Clearing/resetting inputs
- 💡 Passing state and props effectively between components
